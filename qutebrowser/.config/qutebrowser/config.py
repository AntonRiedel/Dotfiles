# Backend to use to display websites. qutebrowser supports two different
# web rendering engines / backends, QtWebKit and QtWebEngine. QtWebKit
# was discontinued by the Qt project with Qt 5.6, but picked up as a
# well maintained fork: https://github.com/annulen/webkit/wiki -
# qutebrowser only supports the fork. QtWebEngine is Qt's official
# successor to QtWebKit. It's slightly more resource hungry than
# QtWebKit and has a couple of missing features in qutebrowser, but is
# generally the preferred choice.
# Type: String
# Valid values:
#   - webengine: Use QtWebEngine (based on Chromium).
#   - webkit: Use QtWebKit (based on WebKit, similar to Safari).

# Which cookies to accept. With QtWebEngine, this setting also controls
# other features with tracking capabilities similar to those of cookies;

# AppCache. Note that with QtWebKit, only `all` and `never` are
# supported as per-domain values. Setting `no-3rdparty` or `no-
# unknown-3rdparty` per-domain on QtWebKit will have the same effect as
# `all`. If this setting is used with URL patterns, the pattern gets
# applied to the origin/first party URL of the page making the request,
# not the request URL.

# Valid values:
