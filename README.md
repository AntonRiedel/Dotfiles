# Dotfiles

My Personal Dotfiles which I use across different machines. In particular, you can find configuration files for:

* termite
* bash
* neovim
* vifm
* i3
* i3blocks

These Dotfiles are meant to be deployed with GNU Stow (https://stevenrbaker.com/tech/managing-dotfiles-with-gnu-stow.html).
