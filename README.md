# Dotfiles

My personal Dotfiles which I use across different machines. I run Void Linux as my main operating system with a custom build of dwm as window manager and st as terminal.
You can find configuration files for

* bash (shell)
* neovim (editor)
* tmux (screen multiplexer)
* vifm (file browser)
* dunst (notification daemon)
* sxhkd (hotkey daemon)
* htop (system monitor)
* neofetch (system information tool)

as well as some custom scripts (under `scripts`).

These Dotfiles are meant to be deployed with [GNU Stow](https://stevenrbaker.com/tech/managing-dotfiles-with-gnu-stow.html).

Under `old` you can find configuration files for programs I used to use such as:

* i3 (->dwm)
* i3bar (->build-in bar of dwm)
* termite (->st)
* urxvt (->st)
* xterm (->st)
* lxterminal (->st)
* ranger (->vifm)
* zsh (->bash)
* compton (->xcompmgr)
